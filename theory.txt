react is a liberary of js
developed by facebook
React work on SPA(single page application) but will work in multiple pages as well
it is a component(function or chunk of code) based liberary
render means page does not get reload but all the function inside it gets reloaded making page slower
reload completely reloads page
react don't use DOM it uses virtual Dom(vd) that's why react is faster as it uses vd.
react have two virtual dom new and old vd this two part is called 'diffing'
